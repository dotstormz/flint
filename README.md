Flint is an extension the the Silex micro-framework and routing library from SensioLabs, that adds some useful structure to your project, as well as adding a declarative config format for defining routes, services and controllers. Flint’s main aim is to help you “fall into the pit of success”; for example, enabling easy unit testing of all of your application code by ensuring all classes are proper Silex services.
